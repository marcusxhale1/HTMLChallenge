HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor Challenge
This is my submission for the HTML CSS Git Challenge 
The challenge
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards 
WHEN they view the source code 
THEN they find semantic HTML elements 
WHEN they view the strucute of the HTML elements
THEN they find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning 
WHEN they find the image elements 
THEN they find accessible alt attributes
WHEN they view the heading attributes 
THEN they fall in sequential order 
WHEN they view the title element
THEN they find a concise, descrptive title

This was a lot of fun, and helped build my confidence. Looking forward to the next challenge.
